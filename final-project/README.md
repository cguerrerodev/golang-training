# Golang Development Program - Level 6 Final Project

# Statement
You are to design the backend side of a system for the following business idea.
We want to build a site called QuestionsAndAnswers.com that will compete with Quora/Stackoverflow and others with 1 major difference. We will only allow 1 answer per question. If someone thinks they have a better answer, they will have to update the existing answer for that question instead of adding another answer. In essence, each question can only have 0 or 1 answer.
The backend should support the following operations:
- Get one question by its ID
- Get a list of all questions
- Get all the questions created by a given user
- Create a new question
- Update an existing question (the statement and/or the answer)
- Delete an existing question
